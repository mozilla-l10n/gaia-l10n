# The error for when the user tries to create an account without a network
# connection active.
# The error for either a bad username or a bad password.  For security reasons,
# servers try not to distinguish between the two which is why we also cannot
# tell them apart either.  Also, if the user made a typo, they could have made
# it in either place.
# The error for a bad e-mail address. We tried to send email but
# couldn't because the server said it was a bad address.
# The error for a user having the correct username and password, but the mail
# server explicitly indicates they don't have permission to talk to the mail
# server.  This is currently only expected from ActiveSync servers; situations
# like gmail over IMAP indicating that IMAP is disabled for the account or
# domain have their own error code: setup-error-imap-disabled.
# The error for when the server is not good enough to be supported
# because it is missing the required features.
# The fallback error; if we don't have a better error, we report this.
# The error for Gmail accounts where 2-factor authentication (where you receive
# a text message on your phone or run a special app) is enabled, and so the
# user needs to create and use an application specific password to allow us to
# talk to the server.
# The error for Gmail accounts where IMAP is not enabled.  This can occur
# for individual users where they have disabled IMAP from the settings UI.
# This can also occur for apps-for-domains where the domain is not configured
# to support IMAP.
# The error for Gmail accounts where POP3 is not enabled.  This can occur
# for individual users where they have disabled POP3 from the settings UI.
# This can also occur for apps-for-domains where the domain is not configured
# to support POP3.
# The error for when we are able to contact a server that should be the mail
# server but we are unable to establish a secure connection.
# The error for when we try to contact a server but see no indication of a
# response before we give up because of a timeout.
# The error for when we able to establish a (secure) connection with the server,
# but there is some type of failure talking to the server that isn't covered by
# other errors.  Hopefully this is just a temporary problem on the server, but
# it could also be a fundamental incompatibility between our software and the
# server's software.
# The error for when we are trying to figure out the right server settings for
# an account based on the e-mail address the user typed in during configuration,
# but we can't find the right settings.  This is either because the user made a
# typo and so we are looking for configuration data that does not exist, there
# were network failures trying to look the information up, or the information is
# not available.
# The error for when the user is trying to set up an account with a server that
# currently indicates it is offline for maintenance.
# The error when the user trying to register a duplicate account

# When dealing with an account that involves multiple types of

# we augment the account name in the string with a label to help

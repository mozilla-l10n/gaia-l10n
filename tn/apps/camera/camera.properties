# LOCALIZATION NOTE (camera-resolution-header): if you leave the original
# en-US value "{{camera-resolution}}" in the following string, the localization
# will be automatically picked from the existing string with ID "camera-resolution".
# If you need to adapt your localization to the reduced space available in
# headers, you can use a shorter string here. The same comment is valid for
# all -header strings using a {{variable}}.











# The following strings are spoken by screen readers and not shown on the

# LOCALIZATION NOTE
#
# [For localizers]
# We can't render these strings correctly for RTL locales, so we have to put LRE (&#x202a;)
# and PDF (&#x202c;) entities to these translations to force the correct direction.
#
# RTL locales should have a translation similar to this:
# hotspot-wpa-psk.innerHTML= &#x202a;WPA (TKIP)&#x202c;
# hotspot-wpa2-psk.innerHTML= &#x202a;WPA2 (AES)&#x202c;
#
# [More details]
#
# Please check settings.ar.properties to see the difference first.
#
# We have to put "&#x202a;" and "&#x202c;" these two RTL related characters
# in Arabic locales to make sure these two strings would not be translated
# automatically in a wrong way by browser. Because from engineering side,
# we can only change settings.ar.properties, for localizers, please remember to
# put them in the other RTL languages.
#
# Additionally, in order to make this hack work, we got some help from l10n.js
# that we need to put these strings inside "KEY".innerHTML, so that's the
# reason why these two strings below would be suffixed with ".innerHTML"

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(thread-header): parameters in this string will be replaced
# at runtime. {{numberType}} is the label associated to the number ('work',
# 'home', etc.), {{numberDetail}} is either the phone number or the carrier's
# name. Resulting example for en-US: "mobile | +123456789", "mobile | Verizon".

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(thread-separator): used to separate type/carrier from
# the number itself. It should be consistent with the characters used in
# "thread- header", \u20 is a blank space (\u20|\u20 is equivalent to " | ").

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(carrier-separator): used to separate carrier's name from
# the number itself. \u20 is a blank space. Resulting example for en-US:
# "Verizon, +123456789".

#LOCALIZATION NOTE (fdnBlocked2Body): the English translation does not need the
# actual number of phone numbers. If your translation needs it, you can still add it
# using the parameter {{ n }}. Also take into account that you could add HTML so be
# careful with the content, it may affect to the whole app.
# no need to retranslate title and buttons if not necessary

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (files-too-large): the English translation does not need the
# actual number of files. If your translation needs it, you can still add it

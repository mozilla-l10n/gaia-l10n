# and the whole string should not exceed a length of ~10 latin characters.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE: the prime (’) can be used to represent minutes for most
# locales, but we use “m” instead for the English locale to prevent a possible
# confusion (35’ ago ≠ 35 feet ago).

# This variable will be used to select time picker order
# H - hour
# M - minute
# p - dayperiod (am/pm)

# If 24h time format is selected, then the %H will display 24h clock and
# p will be ignored.

# This variable will be used to select date picker order
# Y - year
# M - month
# D - day

# Character used in timePicker to separate hours from minutes

# Localize “AM" and "PM" used in %p format for time

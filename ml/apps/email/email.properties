# When dealing with an account that involves multiple types of

# we augment the account name in the string with a label to help

# names, but it may make sense to place the name of the protocol

# LOCALIZATION NOTE: do not translate {name}

# L10n note: These are the labels we use when displaying the envelope info for a
# message that is forwarded inline.  While automatic recovery of this
# information by clients is made difficult by these strings regularly being
# localized, we attempt to remain consistent with apps such as Thunderbird for
# at least English.
# This really wants to have the dash in it for consistency with Thunderbird

# Localized folder names for IMAP servers.  Because the IMAP standard did not
# originally specify a way to express meta-data about folders, folders may be
# named in English to express their purpose.  Then e-mail clients (or webmail
# interfaces) localize these values.  We do this too, following in the
# footsteps of Thunderbird.

# In the folder picker drawer, there is a transparent area for the header,
# and a tap region to take the user back to the message list. So this text is
# not visible by the user, but could be used for accessibility.

# In the folder picker drawer, the list of email accounts are shown. This is
# the header for that section.

# At the bottom of the folder picker drawer, there is an icon link that
# goes to the account settings. This string is only used for accessibility
# concerns, and is not visible visually.

# folder-last-synced-label is shown in the message-list, in the
# middle of its bottom toolbar, and shows the last sync time for the currently
# displayed list of messages in the folder. Since space is tight in that area,
# the app code detects if the string will be too long and it will shrink the
# font size to fit longer text.



# senders-separation-sign separates the email accounts of senders.
# Notice that we have a space after the comma.

# new-emails refers to the text shown on a notification that users
# get when they receive new, unread email. The ui component that utilizes
# this lives in apps/email/js/message_list_topbar.js.

# new-emails-notify-one-account is used when a system notification is generated during
# a periodic background sync with the server. Since this goes to the system's
# notification area, and user has only one account configured with the email App.

# new-emails-notify-multiple-accounts is used in the same situation
# as new-emails-notify-one-account.
# In this case, the user has more than one account configured
# with the email app.

# new-emails-notify-multiple-accounts-body is used in the same situation
# as new-emails-notify-multiple-accounts.
# This is the body part of the notification.

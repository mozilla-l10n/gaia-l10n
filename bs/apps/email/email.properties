# The placeholder for the display name of the user that will be displayed in the
# account setup screen input box for the display name until they enter any text
# in the box.  When you send an e-mail, the "From" header contains the user's
# display name ("John Doe") as well as the e-mail address
# ("john.doe@example.com").  In the future this input box will be labeled, but
# it is currently unlabeled because of screen real estate concerns.
# The placeholder for the user's e-mail address that will be displayed in the
# account setup screen input box for the e-mail address until they enter any
# text in the box.  The value will be used to configure the e-mail account.
# The placeholder for the user's password that will be displayed in the account
# setup screen input box for the password until they enter any text in the box.
# The value will be used to configure the e-mail account and saved for future

# The error for when the user tries to create an account without a network
# connection active.
# The error for either a bad username or a bad password.  For security reasons,
# servers try not to distinguish between the two which is why we also cannot
# tell them apart either.  Also, if the user made a typo, they could have made
# it in either place.
# The error for a bad e-mail address. We tried to send email but
# couldn't because the server said it was a bad address.
# The error for a user having the correct username and password, but the mail
# server explicitly indicates they don't have permission to talk to the mail
# server.  This is currently only expected from ActiveSync servers; situations
# like gmail over IMAP indicating that IMAP is disabled for the account or
# domain have their own error code: setup-error-imap-disabled.
# The error for when the server is not good enough to be supported
# because it is missing the required features.
# The fallback error; if we don't have a better error, we report this.
# The error for Gmail accounts where 2-factor authentication (where you receive
# a text message on your phone or run a special app) is enabled, and so the
# user needs to create and use an application specific password to allow us to
# talk to the server.
# The error for Gmail accounts where IMAP is not enabled.  This can occur
# for individual users where they have disabled IMAP from the settings UI.
# This can also occur for apps-for-domains where the domain is not configured
# to support IMAP.
# The error for Gmail accounts where POP3 is not enabled.  This can occur
# for individual users where they have disabled POP3 from the settings UI.
# This can also occur for apps-for-domains where the domain is not configured
# to support POP3.
# The error for when we are able to contact a server that should be the mail
# server but we are unable to establish a secure connection.
# The error for when we try to contact a server but see no indication of a
# response before we give up because of a timeout.
# The error for when we able to establish a (secure) connection with the server,
# but there is some type of failure talking to the server that isn't covered by
# other errors.  Hopefully this is just a temporary problem on the server, but
# it could also be a fundamental incompatibility between our software and the
# server's software.
# The error for when we are trying to figure out the right server settings for
# an account based on the e-mail address the user typed in during configuration,
# but we can't find the right settings.  This is either because the user made a
# typo and so we are looking for configuration data that does not exist, there
# were network failures trying to look the information up, or the information is
# not available.
# The error for when the user is trying to set up an account with a server that
# currently indicates it is offline for maintenance.
# The error when the user trying to register a duplicate account

# For account settings screen, there are sections of settings, and each
#section has a header. One is Account, which shows general information
# about the account, like the name.

# Label in the "Account" sub-section of account settings that shows the
# human name, not the email address, for the account.

# Label in the "Account" sub-section of account settings for the checkbox
# that enables getting phone notifications when new inbox email is found
# via periodic sync with the mail server.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(settings-account-play-sound-onsend): Label in the "Account"

# For account settings screen, there are sections of settings, and each

# Label in the "Data" sub-section of acccount settings for the select box
# that allows choosing how often to check the server for new messages in
# the inbox. The possible select box options are listed in the

# For account settings screen, there are sections of settings, and each

# name/password and server addresses.

# Label in the "Server settings" sub-section of acccount settings for going
# to a settings card that shows user name and password used to connect to

# When dealing with an account that involves multiple types of
# connections, such as IMAP and POP3 which both use SMTP for sending,
# we augment the account name in the string with a label to help
# clarify to the user which account type they are dealing with. For
# most users, the same password will be used for the IMAP server and
# the SMTP server, and they will only ever see the IMAP or POP3 label.
# But some users with unusual server configurations will also see the
# SMTP variant. These unusual users will probably have received
# specific instructions from their ISP that involve use of the
# protocol names. In general we expect that localizers will want to
# leave the protocol names as-is since they are technical protocol
# names, but it may make sense to place the name of the protocol
# before the account type for certain languages.

# Note that the account name is displayed as a string that is
# displayed in its entirety, so you don't need to worry about clipping
# or ellipses.



# How often to check the mail server for new mail messages for the inbox.
# "Manually" means, do not automatically connect on a periodic sync interval.
# User will manually click the refresh button to check for new messages.

# Dynamically added sync interval checks. These are only added via special
# debug/development tools, and are always in seconds. Otherwise, just
# the settings-check-every-* options are visible.



# How much email to sync, in smallest unit of days, from the server. Only
# valid for ActiveSync mail servers, not shown for other mail server types
# like IMAP.





# Shown when user taps on attachment icon in compose, but the app still
# needs a bit more time to finishing the add of the previous attachment.


# If a file is attached to an email but it does not have a name, this

# added to the end of the default name to distinguish the files from

# L10n note: These are the labels we use when displaying the envelope info for a
# message that is forwarded inline.  While automatic recovery of this
# information by clients is made difficult by these strings regularly being
# localized, we attempt to remain consistent with apps such as Thunderbird for
# at least English.
# This really wants to have the dash in it for consistency with Thunderbird

# Localized folder names for IMAP servers.  Because the IMAP standard did not
# originally specify a way to express meta-data about folders, folders may be
# named in English to express their purpose.  Then e-mail clients (or webmail
# interfaces) localize these values.  We do this too, following in the
# footsteps of Thunderbird.

# In the folder picker drawer, there is a transparent area for the header,
# and a tap region to take the user back to the message list. So this text is

# In the folder picker drawer, the list of email accounts are shown. This is
# the header for that section.

# At the bottom of the folder picker drawer, there is an icon link that
# goes to the account settings. This string is only used for accessibility
# concerns, and is not visible visually.

# folder-last-synced-label is shown in the message-list, in the
# middle of its bottom toolbar, and shows the last sync time for the currently
# displayed list of messages in the folder. Since space is tight in that area,
# the app code detects if the string will be too long and it will shrink the
# font size to fit longer text.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(message-list-top-action):
# In the message-list, as the user scrolls down, an action bar will scroll into

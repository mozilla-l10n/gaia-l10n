# LOCALIZATION NOTE(phone-type-separator): used to separate phone type from
# the number itself. It should be consistent with the characters used in
# "thread- header", \u20 is a blank space (,\u20 is equivalent to ", "). It can
# be used together with "phone-carrier-separator" if carrier is available.
# Resulting example for en-US: "Mobile, +123456789" or if carrier is available
# "Mobile, +123456789 Carrier".

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(phone-carrier-separator): used to separate carrier's name

#LOCALIZATION NOTE (fdnBlocked2Body): the English translation does not need the
# actual number of phone numbers. If your translation needs it, you can still add it
# using the parameter {{ n }}. Also take into account that you could add HTML so be
# careful with the content, it may affect to the whole app.
# no need to retranslate title and buttons if not necessary

# {{date}} is replaced at run-time with a date. The format used to display
# this date is specified in the string with ID 'expiry-date-format'.

# composer (above the send button) and in the thread list for the thread with
# MMS as the last message.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (files-too-large): the English translation does not need the
# actual number of files. If your translation needs it, you can still add it

# some DSDS related localizations
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (send-button-sim-indication): don't localize the
# sim-indication itself as we use it to show the SIM number only. Yet obviously,
# the "ariaLabel" needs to be localized.

# Date formats specific for SMS app

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (expiry-date-format): this is a date format.
# See http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/strftime.html
# %A is the full weekday name from shared/date/date.properties and it might
# not be in the correct grammatical case. To work around this issue, you can
# use a different format like "%m/%d/%Y".

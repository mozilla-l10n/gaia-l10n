# LOCALIZATION NOTE(new-messages): refers to the text shown inside the email app
# on the message list when new, unread messages have been received while the
# user is looking at the messages in the message list. The ui component that
# uses this lives in apps/email/js/message_list_topbar.js. This display differ
# from the messages that are sent as system notifications. Those are more
# important to distinguish that emails and not SMS messages have been received.
# This display uses the term "Messages" since other text labels in the message
# list also use "Messages" instead of "Emails" since the context of Email is
# assumed as it is in the email app.

# new-emails-notify-one-account is used when a system notification is generated during
# a periodic background sync with the server. Since this goes to the system's
# notification area, and user has only one account configured with the email App.
